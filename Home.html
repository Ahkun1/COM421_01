    <h1> The Research Paper Toolbox </h1>
    <p>Constructing a research paper is an integral part of being a graduate student in the Information Architecture, Technical Communication and Information Design, and Technical Communication programs at IIT. </p>

In this course, you will find an explanation of the basic steps involved in writing a research paper, as well as a selection of tools that complement certain steps. </p>
