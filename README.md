# Climate data exercise #

----------

Create a visualization that compares *CO2 concentration* and *average temperature anomalies* from the NASA data.	
	
## Keep the following in mind ##
- You have two data sets with different time intervals, so you need to adjust the CO2 intervals by generating annual composite data.	You can do that using a pivot table.
- To compare the data sets on the same graph, you'll need a primary and secondary Y-axis.	
- This page on the Excel help forum will give you guidance for a graph with two vertical axes: [https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-or-remove-a-secondary-axis-in-a-chart-in-excel-91da1e2f-5db1-41e9-8908-e1a2e14dd5a9](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-or-remove-a-secondary-axis-in-a-chart-in-excel-91da1e2f-5db1-41e9-8908-e1a2e14dd5a9)	
- You can do this project in Google Sheets as well (though you will have to format the data yourself in a text editor and paste it into Sheets). See these instructions for making the graph: [https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9085334?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en	](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9085334?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en )
- **Try to import the data, create the aggregate data, and make the visualization yourself first.** Use the Excel file as a reference to help you along the way if you get stuck.	
	
## Sheets in the Excel workbook ##
1. *Metadata* - Description of content
2. *CO2* - CO2 data imported and cleaned from NASA text file
1. *CO2\_Pivot\_Annual* - CO2 data as annual composite in pivot table
1. *TEMP* - Temperature anomaly data imported and cleaned from NASA text file
1. *Solution_data* - CO2 aggregate and temperature annual data, plus (quickly) formatted visualization. **Try to create the visualization first before you look at this graph.**


Again, try to import the data and create the visualization yourself before  you consult the solution.
