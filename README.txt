CSS Positioning Exercise

Try to get the CSS in screen.css to reflect the solution file. To view that file, change the CSS link in <head>. Don't look at the values in solution.css--that defeats the purpose of the exercise.

Note: screen.css already has some values in it. Those are to help you with the layout, so you probably don't want to change them around too much. The page also automatically loads normalize.css, which takes out the default browser styling.

Things to think about:

1) How many objects are on the page. You'll need to use z-index to stack them. What order do they go in, top to bottom?
2) What type of positioning should you use? Abosulute? Relative? Fixed?
3) Each item should be based off a fixed reference point. What object on the page is most likely to help you determine the relative size of other objects?
